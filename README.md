# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in Software Development & Artificial Intelligence. I am currently working as Student Researcher at [Institute of Mathematics](http://math.ac.vn/), Intern at [2020 MOST GASE TAIWAN Global Talent Internship Program: Artificial Intelligence and Green Technology](https://gasesummer.most.ntu.edu.tw/supervisors#Artificial)

I am writing a [Computer Science Handbook](https://github.com/hoduchieu01/Computer-Science-Handbook) to create a material for our community training and spread knowledge about computers science. I would love to hear your feedback and welcome you to contribute to this project.
