# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in Software Development & Artificial Intelligence. I am currently working as Student Researcher at [Institute of Mathematics](http://math.ac.vn/), Intern at [2020 MOST GASE TAIWAN Global Talent Internship Program: Artificial Intelligence and Green Technology](https://gasesummer.most.ntu.edu.tw/supervisors#Artificial), Core Maintainer at [Open Source Education Bot, Facebook]()

I am writing a [Computer Science Handbook](https://github.com/hoduchieu01/Computer-Science-Handbook) to create a training material for our community training and spread knowledge about computers science. I would love to hear your feedback and welcome you to contribute to this project.

I am happy to connect with recruiters, software engineers, friends, community program leads and anyone who share some of the interests with me! I'm currently looking for internships in software development and machine learning.
